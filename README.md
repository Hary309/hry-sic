[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Harry09/Smooth-Interior-Camera.svg)](https://github.com/Harry09/Smooth-Interior-Camera/releases/tag/1.3.1.0)

# SCS Software has officially added features from my mod to the game in the 1.53 update, so I've decided to retire the project. The mod is compatible with game versions up to 1.52.

## About

Smooth Interior Camera is mod that improves interior camera by adding smooth rotation animation.

This mod is based on [hry-core](https://github.com/Hary309/hry-core) - a small framework for creating mods for ETS 2 and ATS.

Keep it in mind that this is still in beta, so it may cause some bug or crashes, look at `How to report a bug/crash` to report such thing.
